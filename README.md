# KOKI_sharp_waves

poisson_proc.py + generate_spike_train.py -> spikeTrain.npz
(or with Matlab codes: gen_firingrate.m, inom_poisson.m, spike_trains.m)

stdp_network_b.py + spikeTrain.npz -> wmx.txt (learning process)

(plotrast_origin.m - raster plot)

(plotdynattr_origin.m - plot of the global activity)

(showmatrix2_origin.m - shows the weight matrix)

spw_network4a_1.py - activity during sleep/rest

spw_network4_automatized.py - check the activity with varios scaling factors (and detect replays)
